# Day-2-[10-3-2023]

Day 1 Summary â†’

```graphql
1. Explore target application and map every functionality it using.
2. While mapping every functions -> ask questions to ourself and understand what exactly functionality doing and do opposite of it
3. Check git of target and see if anything exposed credentials or not
4. Can try Log4j payloads on every headers including Accept header
5. During Testing also check mail regaring our target and see how URL is structured and what is there and if anything is suspicious check for it and see what encoding methods are there. Play with it
6. CRLF to XSS -> be creative -> Learned new thing - GBK Encoding
```
